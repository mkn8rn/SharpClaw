# mk8.shell — Agent Command Language

## Overview

mk8.shell is a restricted pseudocode shell language that agents use to execute
system operations. By design, **there is no generic shell execution verb** — agents
can only use the closed set of verbs defined in the `Mk8ShellVerb` enum.

Scripts are compiled server-side into either in-memory .NET API calls or
tightly-validated process invocations. Agents never see or interact with a real
shell. Arguments are always passed as structured arrays — never concatenated
into a command string — eliminating the injection surface entirely.

**Only ProcRun spawns an external process.** Everything else (file I/O,
HTTP, text, env, sysinfo) is executed in-memory via .NET APIs. The compiler
never emits bash, cmd, or powershell as an executable.

## Execution Model

mk8.shell runs entirely within .NET — **no terminal or shell process is
ever involved**.

The compiler (`Mk8ShellCompiler`) produces `Mk8CompiledCommand` records.
Each record carries an `Mk8CommandKind` that tells the executor how to
dispatch it:

| `Mk8CommandKind` | Verb categories | Runtime mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `InMemory` | File, Dir, HTTP, Text, Env, Sys, FileTemplate, FilePatch, FileHash, DirTree | .NET APIs directly (`File.ReadAllTextAsync`, `HttpClient`, `System.Security.Cryptography`, etc.) — no process spawned |
| `Process` | ProcRun | `System.Diagnostics.Process` with `UseShellExecute = false`, args via `ArgumentList` |

> **Git via command-template whitelist.**  Git operations are available
> through the strict command-template whitelist (see ProcRun
> section) — only the exact templates registered in `Mk8GitCommands`
> can execute, and no unregistered flag can reach git.  Write
> operations (commit, checkout, switch) are constrained to
> compile-time word lists.  Protected branches (main, master,
> develop, staging, production, live, release/*, trunk) are
> intentionally excluded — agents must work in feature/bugfix/hotfix
> branches only.

**Why no shell?** `ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute = false` combined with
`ArgumentList.Add(arg)` passes each argument individually to the OS
process-creation syscall (`execve` on Linux, `CreateProcessW` on Windows).
Shell metacharacters in argument values (`; rm -rf /`, `$(cmd)`, backticks)
are treated as literal text — they are never interpreted because no shell
parses them.

## Design Principles

1. **Closed verb set** — if it's not in `Mk8ShellVerb`, it cannot be executed
2. **Structured arguments** — `string[]`, never interpolated into a shell string
3. **No shell involved** — compilation targets `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`
4. **Per-verb sanitization** — each verb handler validates its own argument types
5. **Platform-agnostic input** — one script runs on Linux, Windows, or macOS
6. **Scoped paths** — paths can only descend into workspace subdirectories
7. **Compile-time expansion** — ForEach/If are unrolled before execution

## Script Format

A script is an ordered list of operations. The caller provides a **sandbox
ID** and a **script** as separate parameters. mk8.shell handles everything
else: it resolves the sandbox from its own `%APPDATA%/mk8.shell` registry,
verifies the signed environment, builds the workspace context, compiles
the script, executes it, and returns results. The sandbox ID is not part
of the script JSON.

```json
{
  "operations": [
    { "verb": "DirList",   "args": ["$WORKSPACE/app"] },
    { "verb": "FileRead",  "args": ["$WORKSPACE/app/config.json"] },
    {
      "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "build"],
      "maxRetries": 2,
      "stepTimeout": "00:02:00",
      "label": "build",
      "onFailure": "goto:cleanup",
      "captureAs": "BUILD_OUTPUT"
    },
    { "verb": "FileWrite", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/out.txt", "$BUILD_OUTPUT"] },
    { "verb": "DirDelete", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/tmp"], "label": "cleanup" }
  ],
  "cleanup": [

  }
}
```

### Per-Step Fields

| Field        | Type        | Default | Description                                                     |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| verb         | Mk8ShellVerb| —      | Required. The operation to perform.                              |

## Execution Options

| Option          | Type           | Default         | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| maxRetries      | int            | 0               | Default per-step retry count. Per-step `maxRetries` overrides. |
| retryDelay      | TimeSpan       | 2s              | Base delay between retries (exponential back-off).           |
| stepTimeout     | TimeSpan       | 30s             | Max wall-clock time per step before kill.                    |
| scriptTimeout   | TimeSpan       | 5min            | Max wall-clock time for the entire script.                   |
| failureMode     | enum           | StopOnFirstError| `StopOnFirstError`, `ContinueOnError`, `StopAndCleanup`.    |
| maxOutputBytes  | int            | 1 MB            | Max stdout captured per step (truncated).                    |
| maxErrorBytes   | int            | 256 KB          | Max stderr captured per step (truncated).                    |
| pipeStepOutput  | bool           | false           | Makes `$PREV` available — stdout of last step.              |

### Retry Behaviour

- Steps retry on non-zero exit code only (not on compile errors).
- Per-step `maxRetries` overrides the script-level default.
- Delay doubles each attempt: `retryDelay * 2^(attempt-1)`.

### Failure Modes

| Mode              | Behaviour                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| StopOnFirstError  | Abort immediately. Remaining steps are skipped.        |
| ContinueOnError   | Log failure, continue to next step.                    |
| StopAndCleanup    | Abort, then run the `cleanup` operation list.          |

#### StopAndCleanup

When `failureMode` is `StopAndCleanup`, the script accepts a separate
`cleanup` operation list that runs after any failure. Cleanup steps execute
with `ContinueOnError` semantics (best-effort) and go through the same
compilation pipeline — same path validation, same verb restrictions, no
elevated privileges.

```json
{
  "operations": [
    { "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "build"] },
    { "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "publish", "-o", "$WORKSPACE/publish"] }
  ],
  "cleanup": [
    { "verb": "DirDelete",  "args": ["$WORKSPACE/publish"] },
    { "verb": "FileDelete", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/build.lock"] }
  ],
  "options": { "failureMode": "StopAndCleanup" }
}
```

Cleanup operations are compiled identically to main operations and included
in `Mk8CompiledScript.CleanupCommands`. If no `cleanup` list is provided
and a step fails, `StopAndCleanup` behaves like `StopOnFirstError`.

#### Step Labels + Goto-on-Failure

For finer-grained failure handling, individual steps can declare a `label`
and an `onFailure` forward jump:

```json
{ "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "build"], "label": "build", "onFailure": "goto:deploy" },
{ "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "test"] },
{ "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "publish"], "label": "deploy" }
```

**Rules** (enforced by `Mk8LabelValidator` at compile time):
- Labels must be unique within a script.
- Jump targets must reference existing labels.
- Only **forward jumps** allowed — no backward jumps, preventing loops.
- The jump graph is validated as a DAG — no cycles possible.
- Label names: alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only (max 64 chars).
- Labels are metadata — not executable. No new attack surface.

The compiled script includes a `LabelIndex` (label → step index mapping)
that the executor uses to skip ahead on failure.

### Per-Step Timeout Overrides

Per-step `stepTimeout` overrides the script-level `options.stepTimeout`.

```json
{ "verb": "ProcRun",  "args": ["dotnet", "build"],       "stepTimeout": "00:02:00" },
{ "verb": "FileRead", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/output.json"], "stepTimeout": "00:00:05" }
```

This allows slow steps (builds) to have generous timeouts while fast steps
(file reads) that hang are killed promptly.

## Workspace Context

mk8.shell is a **self-contained terminal system**. The caller provides a
sandbox ID and a script — mk8.shell resolves, verifies, compiles, executes,
and returns results entirely on its own. It does not rely on any external
system for sandbox resolution, path validation, or environment loading.

### Sandbox Lifecycle

Every mk8.shell invocation targets a named **sandbox** — an isolated
directory registered via `mk8.shell.startup`. mk8.shell performs the full
lifecycle internally via `Mk8TaskContainer.Create(sandboxId)`:

1. **Load global env** from `mk8.shell.base.env` (ships with the assembly).
2. **Resolve sandbox ID** → local path from mk8.shell's own
   `%APPDATA%/mk8.shell/sandboxes.json` registry.
3. **Verify signature** — read `mk8.shell.signed.env` from sandbox root,
   verify HMAC-SHA256 with the machine-local key.
4. **Extract env vars** from the verified signed content (never from the
   unsigned `.env` — that file exists only for user convenience).
5. **Build `Mk8WorkspaceContext`** with merged environment.
6. **Compile and execute** the script inside an isolated task container.
7. **Dispose** — all state is discarded. Nothing transfers between invocations.

### Sandbox Registration

Sandboxes are created exclusively via `mk8.shell.startup` (the
`Mk8SandboxRegistrar.Register` method). mk8.shell itself has no ability to
create, modify, or manage sandboxes.

Registration creates:
- `mk8.shell.env` — user-editable KEY=VALUE file (never read by mk8.shell at runtime)
- `mk8.shell.signed.env` — cryptographically signed copy (HMAC-SHA256, machine-local key)

Both files are **GIGABLACKLISTED** — mk8.shell commands cannot read, write,
copy, move, delete, hash, or access them in any way. Only the user or
mk8.shell.startup may touch them.

Sandbox names must contain only English letters (A-Z, a-z) and digits (0-9).

### Local Registry (`%APPDATA%/mk8.shell/`)

```
%APPDATA%/mk8.shell/
├── sandboxes.json            ← sandbox ID → { rootPath, registeredAtUtc }
├── mk8.shell.key             ← 256-bit HMAC signing key (machine-local)
└── history/
    ├── Banana_20250101_120000.signed.env
    └── ...                   ← timestamped backup of every signing
```

The signing key ensures that signed env files cannot be copied between
machines without re-signing.

### Where Variables Load From

```
Sandbox Registry (local)
├── RootPath               → $WORKSPACE, Mk8PathSanitizer boundary
└── mk8.shell.signed.env   → additional variables (verified first)

Global (mk8.shell.base.env)
├── ProjectBases            → Mk8RuntimeConfig for command whitelist
└── GitRemoteUrls           → Mk8RuntimeConfig for command whitelist

OS
└── Username                → $USER
```

`$CWD` defaults to the sandbox root. `$WORKSPACE` is always the sandbox root.

### Variable Shortcuts

Variables are resolved at **compile time** — before any process is spawned.
They are not shell environment variables.

| Variable     | Source                           | Example value                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `$WORKSPACE` | Sandbox root path (from registry)| `/home/deploy/sandbox`           |
| `$CWD`       | Working directory (= sandbox root)| `/home/deploy/sandbox`          |
| `$USER`      | OS username                      | `deploy`                         |
| `$PREV`      | stdout of previous step          | `Build succeeded. 0 warnings.`   |

#### How `$PREV` Works

When `pipeStepOutput: true`:

```json
{ "verb": "ProcRun",  "args": ["dotnet", "build"] }
  → stdout: "Build succeeded.\n    0 Warning(s)\n    0 Error(s)"
  → $PREV = "Build succeeded.\n    0 Warning(s)\n    0 Error(s)"

{ "verb": "FileWrite", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/build.log", "$PREV"] }
  → writes the build output to a file
```

When `pipeStepOutput: false` (default), `$PREV` is always empty.

#### Custom Variables

Additional variables are loaded from the sandbox's signed environment file
(`mk8.shell.signed.env`). These are verified on every command startup and
made available as `$NAME` in scripts. Custom variables cannot override
built-in variables (`WORKSPACE`, `CWD`, `USER`, `PREV`).

#### Named Captures (`captureAs`)

Any step can capture its stdout into a named variable via `captureAs`.
The captured value is stored in the variable dictionary and accessible
via `$NAME` in subsequent steps:

```json
{ "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "build"], "captureAs": "BUILD_OUTPUT" },
{ "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "test"],  "captureAs": "TEST_OUTPUT" },
{ "verb": "FileWrite", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/report.txt", "$BUILD_OUTPUT\n$TEST_OUTPUT"] }
```

**Capture rules** (enforced by `Mk8VariableResolver.ValidateCaptures`):
- Max 16 captured variables per script (`Mk8CaptureRules.MaxCaptures`).
- Names may only contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- Cannot override built-ins: `WORKSPACE`, `CWD`, `USER`, `PREV`, `ITEM`, `INDEX`.
- Capture names must be unique within a script.
- Captured variables from process-spawning steps (ProcRun) are
  **blocked in ProcRun arguments** — same injection prevention as `$PREV`.
- Capture size is enforced by existing `maxOutputBytes`.

## Verb Reference

### Filesystem

| Verb       | Args                      | Description                          | Linux equivalent      |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| FileRead   | `[path]`                  | Read entire file contents            | `cat <path>`          |
| FileWrite  | `[path, content]`         | Overwrite file with content          | `echo "content" > f`  |
| FileAppend | `[path, content]`         | Append content to file               | `echo "content" >> f` |
| FileDelete | `[path]`                  | Delete a file                        | `rm <path>`           |
| FileExists | `[path]`                  | Check if file exists (returns bool)  | `test -f <path>`      |
| FileList   | `[path, pattern?]`        | List files matching optional glob    | `ls <path>`           |
| FileCopy   | `[source, destination]`   | Copy a file                          | `cp <src> <dst>`      |
| FileMove   | `[source, destination]`   | Move or rename a file                | `mv <src> <dst>`      |
| FileHash   | `[path, algorithm?]`      | Compute file hash (sha256/sha512/md5)| `sha256sum <path>`    |

`FileHash` returns the hex digest. The algorithm argument defaults to
`sha256`. Executed in-memory via `System.Security.Cryptography` — no
external process, read-only, path must be in sandbox.

### Filesystem — Structured Edits

| Verb         | Args              | Description                               |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| FileTemplate | `[outputPath]`    | Write file from template + replacement values |
| FilePatch    | `[targetPath]`    | Apply ordered find/replace patches to a file  |

#### FileTemplate

Reads a template file, replaces `{{KEY}}` placeholders with literal values,
and writes the result. No eval, no expression language.

```json
{
  "verb": "FileTemplate",
  "args": ["$WORKSPACE/app/appsettings.json"],
  "template": {
    "source": "$WORKSPACE/templates/appsettings.template.json",
    "values": {
      "DB_HOST": "postgres.internal",
      "APP_PORT": "8080"
    }
  }
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Template source must be in sandbox (validated by `Mk8PathSanitizer.Resolve`).
- Output path goes through `ResolveForWrite` (extension blocking applies).
- Values are literal strings only — `$` characters in values are **blocked**
  to prevent variable injection (`{{$PREV}}` attack).
- Max 64 replacement keys (`Mk8FileTemplate.MaxKeys`).

#### FilePatch

Applies ordered find/replace patches to an existing file. Each patch is a
literal string match — no regex (use `TextRegex` separately if needed).
The verb reads the file, applies patches sequentially, writes the result.

```json
{
  "verb": "FilePatch",
  "args": ["$WORKSPACE/app/config.yaml"],
  "patches": [
    { "find": "port: 3000", "replace": "port: 8080" },
    { "find": "debug: true", "replace": "debug: false" }
  ]
}
```

**Constraints:**
- File path goes through `ResolveForWrite` (extension blocking applies).
- Patch values are literal strings — `$` characters are **blocked**.
- Max 32 patches per operation (`Mk8PatchEntry.MaxPatches`).
- `find` cannot be empty.

### Directory

| Verb      | Args              | Description                          | Linux equivalent      |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| DirCreate | `[path]`          | Create directory (recursive)         | `mkdir -p <path>`     |
| DirDelete | `[path]`          | Delete directory recursively         | `rm -rf <path>`       |
| DirList   | `[path]`          | List immediate children              | `ls <path>`           |
| DirExists | `[path]`          | Check if directory exists            | `test -d <path>`      |
| DirTree   | `[path, depth?]`  | Recursive listing up to depth N      | `tree -L <N> <path>`  |

`DirTree` returns a structured recursive listing (one path per line,
indented). Depth defaults to 3, max 5. Read-only, in-memory, no glob.
Path must be in sandbox.

### Process (Strict Command-Template Whitelist)

| Verb    | Args                         | Description                            |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ProcRun | `[binary, arg0, arg1, ...]`  | Run a whitelisted command template     |

ProcRun uses a **strict command-template whitelist** (`Mk8CommandWhitelist`).
There is no "allowed binary + blocked flags" model — every invocation must
match a registered `Mk8AllowedCommand` template EXACTLY.  Each template
defines fixed prefix args, optional flags with typed values, and positional
parameter slots.  The agent can NEVER inject free text into any argument
position.

Templates and word lists are compile-time constants defined in the
`Commands/` directory (one file per tool category).  They cannot be modified
at runtime — to change the allowed surface, a developer edits the source file
and recompiles.

#### Slot types

| Kind | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Choice` | Value must exactly match one of a fixed set | `Release` or `Debug` |
| `SandboxPath` | Value must resolve inside the sandbox via `Mk8PathSanitizer` | `$WORKSPACE/src/app.cs` |
| `AdminWord` | Value must be a single entry from a named word list | `Initial` from MigrationNames |
| `IntRange` | Value must be an integer in [min, max] | `1`–`100` |
| `ComposedWords` | Value is split on spaces; each word must be in a named word list (max 12 words) | `"Fix build errors"` → `["Fix","build","errors"]` all in CommitWords |
| `CompoundName` | Runtime base name + optional compile-time suffix (the ONLY runtime exception) | Base `"Banana"` → `"Banana"`, `"BananaApi"`, `"Banana.Api"` |

#### How ComposedWords works

Spaces are safe — `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList.Add("Fix build errors")`
passes the entire string as one OS-level argument.  No shell tokenizes it.

Each word is validated independently against the word list:
- `"Fix auth errors"` → `["Fix", "auth", "errors"]` → all in CommitWords → **allowed**
- `"Api 1 2 3"` → `["Api", "1", "2", "3"]` → all in CommitWords → **allowed**
- `"Api123"` → tries to match `"Api123"` as one word → NOT in list → **rejected**
- `"I hacked the mainframe"` → `"hacked"` NOT in list → **rejected**

ComposedWords is NOT concatenation.  `"Api 1 2 3"` is allowed (4 separate
words) but `"Api123"` is rejected (one word not in the list).  With single
letters A-Z in the word list, concatenation would accept ANY string,
defeating the whitelist.  This is why AdminWord (single exact match) is used
for migration names and branch names.

#### How CompoundName works (project names)

This is the **ONLY runtime exception** in the whitelist.  Project names are
environment-specific — pre-enumerating all possible base names at compile
time is impractical.  Creating a project is a one-off setup operation with
limited abuse surface.

The administrator provides base names at startup via `Mk8RuntimeConfig`:

```csharp
var config = new Mk8RuntimeConfig { ProjectBases = ["Banana", "SharpClaw"] };
var whitelist = Mk8CommandWhitelist.CreateDefault(config);
```

The whitelist pre-computes all valid combinations at construction time:

- `"Banana"` — base alone
- `"BananaApi"` — base + suffix (direct concatenation)
- `"Banana.Api"` — base + "." + suffix (dot-separated)
- `"Banana.Application.API"` — base + "." + compound suffix

Compile-time suffixes (`Mk8DotnetCommands.ProjectSuffixes`): `App`, `Api`,
`Core`, `Infrastructure`, `Contracts`, `Tests`, `Utils`, `Client`, `Server`,
`Worker`, `Service`, `Web`, `Grpc`, `Shared`, `Common`, `Domain`, `Data`,
`Models`, `Handlers`, `Extensions`, plus compound suffixes like
`Application.API`, `Application.Core`, `PublicAPI`, `UITests`, etc.

If no base names are configured, `dotnet new -n` is unavailable (but
`dotnet new <template>` without `-n` still works — uses directory name).

#### Allowed command templates

**dotnet** (`Mk8DotnetCommands`):

| Template | Flags | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `dotnet --version` | — | — |
| `dotnet --info` | — | — |
| `dotnet build` | `--configuration Release\|Debug`, `--no-restore`, `-o SandboxPath` | — |
| `dotnet publish` | same as build | — |
| `dotnet test` | `--configuration`, `--no-restore`, `--no-build` | — |
| `dotnet clean` | `--configuration` | — |
| `dotnet restore` | `--no-cache` | — |
| `dotnet format` | `--verify-no-changes` | — |
| `dotnet new <template> -n <name>` | `-n`/`--name` CompoundName (runtime base + suffix), `-o` SandboxPath | template from DotnetTemplates |

| `git add .` | — | — |
| `git add -A` | — | — |

| `git checkout -b <branch>` | — | AdminWord from BranchNames |
| `git switch <branch>` | — | AdminWord from BranchNames |
| `git switch -c <branch>` | — | AdminWord from BranchNames |

Word lists:
- **CommitWords**: vocabulary of ~200 verbs, nouns, adjectives, connectors, letters, digits — agent composes messages by combining words with spaces (max 12 words)
- **BranchNames**: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`, plus single letters/digits
- **RemoteNames**: `origin`, `upstream`, `fork`, `backup`, `mirror`
- **GitRemoteUrls**: runtime-configured via `Mk8RuntimeConfig.GitRemoteUrls` (max 16)

**Protected branches — BANNED:** `main`, `master`, `develop`, `staging`,
`production`, `live`, `release`, `release/*`, `trunk`.  These are
intentionally excluded from BranchNames.  Agents must NEVER operate on
branches used for live or master development.  Merging to protected
branches requires `DangerousShellType.Git` with human approval.

Not whitelisted (require dangerous-shell path): `push`, `pull`, `merge`,
`rebase`, `reset`, `clean`, `clone`, `config`, `submodule`, `am`, `apply`,
`filter-branch`, `cherry-pick`, `bisect`, `gc`, `fsck`, `reflog`.

#### Runtime configuration (`Mk8RuntimeConfig`)

The **ONLY runtime exception** in the whitelist.  The administrator provides
environment-specific values at startup:

```csharp
var config = new Mk8RuntimeConfig
{
    ProjectBases = ["Banana", "SharpClaw"],
    GitRemoteUrls = ["https://github.com/org/repo.git"],
};
var whitelist = Mk8CommandWhitelist.CreateDefault(config);
```

These are baked into the immutable whitelist at construction — they cannot be
changed after creation.  Caps: max 32 project bases, max 16 git remote URLs.

If no runtime config is provided, `dotnet new -n` and `git remote add` are
unavailable (the agent gets a clear error message).

**node / npm** (`Mk8NodeNpmCommands`): `node --version`, `npm --version`,
`npm ls` (with `--depth 0-10`, `--all`, `--json`), `npm outdated` (with `--json`).

**cargo** (`Mk8CargoCommands`): `cargo --version` only.

**Archive tools** (`Mk8ArchiveCommands`): create and list ONLY — no
extraction (symlink/traversal risk).  `tar -tf`, `tar -cf`, `tar -czf`,
`gzip`, `gunzip`, `zip`, `unzip -l`.

**Read-only tools** (`Mk8ReadOnlyToolCommands`): `cat`, `head -n`, `tail -n`,
`wc -l/-w/-c`, `sort`, `uniq`, `diff`, `sha256sum`, `md5sum`,
`base64`/`base64 -d`.  All accept ONLY SandboxPath arguments.

#### Defence-in-depth layers

1. **Permanently blocked binaries** (`Mk8BinaryAllowlist`): bash, sh, cmd,
   powershell, python, perl, ruby, curl, wget, find, sudo, chmod, etc.
   Cannot be overridden even with a template.
2. **Command-template whitelist** (`Mk8CommandWhitelist`): only registered
   templates can execute.  Unregistered flags, unknown binaries → rejected.
3. **Typed parameter slots**: every argument position has a slot type.
   No free text reaches any process argument.
4. **`.git/` write protection** (`Mk8PathSanitizer.ResolveForWrite`): blocks
   all writes to paths containing `.git/`, preventing hook injection and
   config tampering.
5. **`.gitattributes` / `.gitmodules` write block**: these filenames are in
   `BlockedWriteFilenames` to prevent filter driver redirection and
   submodule URL manipulation.
6. **Sandbox env GIGABLACKLIST** (`Mk8PathSanitizer.Resolve`): `mk8.shell.env`
   and `mk8.shell.signed.env` are blocked on ALL operations — read, write,
   copy, move, delete, hash, list. Enforced in `Resolve()` itself, not just
   `ResolveForWrite()`. Only the user or mk8.shell.startup may access them.

### Git

Git is available through the strict command-template whitelist:

- **Only registered templates execute.** `git config`, `git -c`, `git push`,
  `git pull`, and all other unregistered subcommands/flags are rejected.
- **Commit messages are composed** from a vocabulary word list — no free text.
- **Branch names are pre-approved** — protected branches are excluded.
- **`.git/` internals are write-protected** — agents cannot create hooks,
  modify config, or inject objects.
- **No push/pull** — code stays local until a human approves.

### HTTP

| Verb       | Args                          | Description        |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| HttpGet    | `[url]`                       | GET request        |

| HttpPut    | `[url, body?]`                | PUT request        |
| HttpDelete | `[url]`                       | DELETE request      |

URL validation: scheme must be `https` (or `http` if opt-in). Host must not
resolve to a private/link-local IP. Port must be 80 or 443.

### Text / Data

| Verb        | Args                       | Description                   |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| TextRegex   | `[input, pattern]`         | Match regex (2s timeout)      |
| TextReplace | `[input, old, new]`        | Simple string replacement     |
| JsonParse   | `[input]`                  | Validate and pretty-print     |
| JsonQuery   | `[input, jsonpath]`        | Extract value by JSONPath     |

### Environment (Read-Only)

| Verb   | Args     | Description                           |
|--------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| EnvGet | `[name]` | Read env var from allowlist only      |

Allowed: `HOME`, `USER`, `PATH`, `LANG`, `TZ`, `TERM`, `PWD`, `HOSTNAME`.
**Blocked:** anything containing `KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PASSWORD`, `CONN`.

### System Info (Read-Only)

| Verb        | Args | Description              | Linux equivalent |
|-------------|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| SysWhoAmI   | `[]` | Current OS username      | `whoami`         |
| SysPwd      | `[]` | Current working directory| `pwd`            |
| SysHostname | `[]` | Machine hostname         | `hostname`       |
| SysUptime   | `[]` | System uptime            | `uptime`         |
| SysDate     | `[]` | Current UTC datetime     | `date -u`        |

## Security Model

### What Cannot Be Expressed

The following are **structurally impossible** in mk8.shell:

- `sudo` / privilege escalation — no verb exists
- Arbitrary shell execution — no `bash -c` verb
- Pipe chains — scripts are sequential, no `|`
- Shell expansion — `$()`, backticks, glob in args are literal strings
- Background processes — no `&` or `nohup`
- Redirection — no `>`, `>>`, `2>&1` (file write is a dedicated verb)
- Chaining — no `&&`, `||`, `;` (operations are a typed array)

### Compilation Safety

The compiler **never** passes arguments through a shell. On all platforms:

```
ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute = false
ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList.Add(arg)  // each arg individually
```

This means shell metacharacters in argument values (`; rm -rf /`) are treated
as literal text by the OS — they are never interpreted.

### Variable Safety

`$VARIABLE` shortcuts are resolved at **compile time** by simple string
replacement — they are not passed to the process environment. This means:

- `$WORKSPACE` in an argument becomes `/home/deploy/sandbox` before the
  process is ever spawned.
- Unknown variables are left as-is (e.g. `$UNKNOWN` stays literal) so the
  executor can report a clear error.
- Agents cannot define variables that override built-ins.
- Variable values are subject to the same per-verb sanitization as any other
  argument — a `$WORKSPACE` that resolves to a path still goes through
  `Mk8PathSanitizer`.
- **`$PREV` is blocked in ProcRun arguments.** The resolver throws a
  `Mk8CompileException` if `$PREV` appears in any ProcRun arg. This prevents
  the attack: `FileRead malicious.txt` → `$PREV` = file contents →
  `ProcRun dotnet $PREV`.
- **Named captures from process steps are also blocked in ProcRun arguments.**
  If `captureAs: "BUILD_OUT"` is set on a ProcRun step, `$BUILD_OUT`
  is blocked in all subsequent ProcRun args — same injection prevention.

### Write Protection (Two-Tier Model)

Write protection uses a **two-tier** model that distinguishes between files
the agent itself could execute vs. files only humans/external tools can run.

#### Tier 1: ALLOWED to write (interpreter-blocked scripts)

These script extensions are writable because **every interpreter that could
run them is permanently blocked** in the ProcRun allowlist:

`.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.fish`, `.csh`, `.ksh` — shells blocked
`.bat`, `.cmd`, `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` — cmd/powershell blocked
`.py`, `.rb`, `.pl`, `.lua`, `.php` — all interpreters blocked
`.service`, `.timer`, `.cron`, `.crontab` — systemctl/crontab blocked

Use case: agent writes a deployment script for a human operator, or an
admin-level `.sh` file that a CI pipeline picks up independently.

```
FileWrite  ["$WORKSPACE/deploy.sh", "#!/bin/bash\napt update && ..."]  → OK
FileWrite  ["$WORKSPACE/setup.py", "from setuptools import ..."]       → OK
```

The agent cannot execute these because `bash`, `sh`, `python`, `python3`,
`powershell`, and all other interpreters are permanently blocked.

#### Tier 2: BLOCKED from writing (executable by OS or allowed binaries)

| Category | Extensions / Names | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Native executables | `.exe`, `.com`, `.scr`, `.msi`, `.msp`, `.dll`, `.bin`, `.run`, `.elf`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.appimage` | OS runs directly |
| Node.js code files | `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` | `node` is on the allowlist |
| MSBuild project files | `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`, `.proj`, `.targets`, `.props`, `.sln` | `dotnet build` executes `<Exec>` targets |
| Rust source files | `.rs` | `cargo build` executes `build.rs` scripts |
| Windows script host | `.jse`, `.wsf`, `.wsh`, `.msh`, `.vbs`, `.vbe` | OS can invoke via file association |
| Build config files (by name) | `Makefile`, `GNUmakefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `.npmrc`, `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `nuget.config`, `package.json`, `build.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitmodules`, `mk8.shell.env`, `mk8.shell.signed.env` | Build tools execute code from these implicitly / sandbox security |

##### Why these are blocked: the binary planting attack

The mk8.shell sandbox is a real directory on a real server. Other software
often shares that directory — CI runners, web servers, application runtimes,
container bind-mounts. If the agent could write native executables or
shared libraries, a **separate process** could load them without the agent
ever invoking them itself.

**Concrete scenario — DLL hijacking via shared build directory:**

```
/home/deploy/sandbox/           ← mk8.shell $WORKSPACE
├── app/
│   ├── MyApp.csproj
│   └── bin/Release/net10.0/
│       ├── MyApp.dll           ← legitimate app
│       └── Newtonsoft.Json.dll ← legitimate dependency
```

A CI pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions self-hosted runner, cron job) runs
`dotnet MyApp.dll` in this directory on a schedule. If the agent could
write `.dll` files:

```
Step 1: FileWrite ["$WORKSPACE/app/bin/Release/net10.0/Newtonsoft.Json.dll",
                    "<trojanized assembly bytes>"]
        → Replaces the real dependency with a malicious one.

Step 2: (Agent does nothing — just waits.)

Step 3: CI runner executes: dotnet MyApp.dll
        → .NET runtime loads Newtonsoft.Json.dll from bin/
        → Trojanized code runs as the CI service account (often root or
          a deployment user with production credentials).
```

The agent never executed anything dangerous. It only wrote a file. The
damage happens when a completely separate process trusts the filesystem.

**Other variants of the same pattern:**

| Shared process | Agent writes | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| nginx with CGI directory in sandbox | `.exe` CGI binary | HTTP request triggers execution as `www-data` |
| Python app importing from sandbox | `.so` native extension | `import somelib` loads the `.so` at import time |
| Any Linux process with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` including sandbox | `.so` named `libcurl.so.4` | Process loads it instead of the real library at startup |
| Docker host with bind-mount to sandbox | `.exe` in mounted volume | Another container or the host process runs it |
| Java app with classpath in sandbox | `.jar` file | JVM loads it, `static {}` initializer runs |
| Windows service monitoring a folder | `.dll` plugin | Service dynamically loads new DLLs from watched directory |

Tier 1 scripts (`.sh`, `.py`, `.ps1`) don't have this problem — no process
accidentally interprets a `.sh` file. Shell scripts require explicit
invocation (`bash script.sh`) or the execute bit (`chmod +x`, which is
permanently blocked). Native executables and shared libraries, on the
other hand, are loaded implicitly by runtimes, linkers, and OS loaders.

#### Tier 3: ProcRun code-file argument blocking

Even if a file extension is allowed for writing, ProcRun validates that
no argument points to a code file an allowed binary would interpret:

```
ProcRun ["node", "$WORKSPACE/script.js"]  → BLOCKED (code-file argument)
ProcRun ["node", "--version"]             → OK (no code file)
ProcRun ["make", "-f", "Makefile"]        → BLOCKED (dangerous config)
```

### Execution Limits

Execution options provide ceilings for retries and timeouts. Per-step
overrides can extend but not exceed script-level defaults.

## Control Flow

### ForEach (compile-time unroll)

ForEach is **not a runtime loop** — it's syntactic sugar that the expander
unrolls into N concrete operations before compilation. The agent cannot
observe intermediate results between iterations.

```json
{
  "verb": "ForEach",
  "forEach": {
    "items": ["src/a.txt", "src/b.txt", "src/c.txt"],
    "body": {
      "verb": "FileCopy",
      "args": ["$WORKSPACE/$ITEM", "$WORKSPACE/backup/$ITEM"]
    }
  }
}
```

Expands to 3 FileCopy operations at compile time. Available placeholders:
- `$ITEM` — the current item string
- `$INDEX` — 0-based iteration index

**Limits:**
- Max 256 items per ForEach (`Mk8ForEach.MaxExpansion`)
- Max 1024 total operations after expansion (`Mk8ScriptExpander.MaxExpandedOperations`)
- Max nesting depth: 3
- Nested ForEach is forbidden (no `ForEach` inside `ForEach.Body`)

### If (conditional guard)

If evaluates a predicate and either includes or skips the guarded operation.
No else branch, no boolean operators, no nesting beyond depth 3.

```json
{
  "verb": "If",
  "if": {
    "predicate": { "kind": "PrevContains", "args": ["Build succeeded"] },
    "then": { "verb": "FileWrite", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/status.txt", "build ok"] }
  }
}
```

**Available predicates:**

| Kind          | Args               | Evaluated at | Description                              |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| PrevContains  | `[substring]`      | Compile time | True if `$PREV` contains substring       |
| PrevEmpty     | `[]`               | Compile time | True if `$PREV` is empty/whitespace      |
| EnvEquals     | `[name, expected]` | Compile time | True if env var equals value (allowlist)  |
| FileExists    | `[path]`           | Runtime      | Deferred — executor checks at step time  |
| DirExists     | `[path]`           | Runtime      | Deferred — executor checks at step time  |

## Batch Operations

Batch verbs reduce script verbosity when operating on multiple files.
They expand to individual operations at compile time — same validation
applies per file.

### FileWriteMany

```json
{
  "verb": "FileWriteMany",
  "args": [
    "$WORKSPACE/src/index.ts", "export {}",
    "$WORKSPACE/src/config.ts", "export const config = {}",
    "$WORKSPACE/README.md", "# My Project"
  ]
}
```

Args are pairs: `[path1, content1, path2, content2, ...]`. Max 64 files.
Each pair expands to a `FileWrite` — executable extension blocking applies.

### FileCopyMany

```json
{
  "verb": "FileCopyMany",
  "args": [
    "$WORKSPACE/template/a.txt", "$WORKSPACE/out/a.txt",
    "$WORKSPACE/template/b.txt", "$WORKSPACE/out/b.txt"
  ]
}
```

Args are pairs: `[src1, dst1, src2, dst2, ...]`. Max 64 pairs.

### FileDeleteMany

```json
{ "verb": "FileDeleteMany", "args": ["$WORKSPACE/tmp/a.log", "$WORKSPACE/tmp/b.log"] }
```

Args are paths. Max 64 paths.

## Script Composition (Include)

The `Include` verb references admin-approved script fragments by ID.
Fragments are resolved at expand time from a server-side registry
(`IMk8FragmentRegistry`) — agents cannot define fragments, only reference
them. This is compile-time inlining, not runtime function calls.

```json
{
  "operations": [
    { "verb": "Include", "args": ["setup-workspace"] },
    { "verb": "ProcRun", "args": ["dotnet", "build"] },
    { "verb": "Include", "args": ["deploy-to-staging"] }
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Agents reference fragments by ID only (e.g. `"setup-workspace"`).
- Admins register fragments via `Mk8InMemoryFragmentRegistry.Register`.
- Fragment IDs: letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, periods (max 128 chars).
- Fragments cannot contain `Include` (no nested composition).
- Expansion depth counts toward the nesting limit (max 3).
- Total expanded operation cap (1024) still applies.
- Fragments go through the same compilation pipeline — same path
  validation, same verb restrictions, same security model.

## Scoped Path Builder

`Mk8ScopedPath` constructs workspace-relative paths that can **only descend**
into subdirectories. The agent never needs to know the absolute sandbox path.

```
Mk8ScopedPath.Join("src", "components", "App.tsx")
→ "$WORKSPACE/src/components/App.tsx"

Mk8ScopedPath.JoinCwd("output", "build.log")
→ "$CWD/output/build.log"

Mk8ScopedPath.Join("..", "..", "etc", "passwd")
→ THROWS Mk8CompileException
```

**Validation rules:**
- No `..` segments (throws immediately)
- No absolute path segments
- No null bytes, control characters, or Windows reserved names
- No trailing dots (Windows device name tricks)
- Forward slashes in a segment are split into sub-segments
- The resulting `$WORKSPACE/...` path is STILL validated by
  `Mk8PathSanitizer` after variable resolution — double defence

## Compilation Pipeline

```
Agent submits Mk8ShellScript
       │
       ▼
Mk8ScriptExpander.Expand()           ← unrolls ForEach/If/Batch/Include
       │                                (Include inlines from IMk8FragmentRegistry)
       │                                (cleanup operations expanded separately)

├── CleanupCommands   (compiled cleanup ops, if StopAndCleanup)
└── LabelIndex        (label → step index, if labels used)
```

## Audit Log

Every compiled script can produce a complete audit trail via
`Mk8AuditLog.CreateEntries()`. Each step records what the agent
requested, what was compiled, and what actually ran:

```
Mk8ShellAuditEntry
├── JobId                              unique job identifier
├── StepIndex                          0-based step position
├── RequestedVerb + RequestedArgs      pre-compilation (agent's input)
├── CompiledExecutable + CompiledArgs  post-compilation (resolved paths, validated args)
├── ExitCode                           process exit code or 0 for in-memory ops
├── Output / Error                     captured stdout/stderr (truncated to limits)
├── StartedAt / CompletedAt            UTC timestamps
├── Attempts                           retry count (1 = no retries)
└── SandboxRoot                        workspace boundary at execution time
```

This enables:
- **Post-incident analysis:** "the agent wrote `deploy.sh` with these
  contents at 14:23, then committed it at 14:24."
- **Rate limiting:** detecting agents that issue suspiciously many write
  operations.
- **Compliance:** full traceability from agent request → compiled command →
  execution result.
