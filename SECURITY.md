## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in SharpClaw, **do not open a public issue**.

This repository has GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting enabled.  
Please report vulnerabilities using the “Report a vulnerability” option in the repository’s Security tab:

https://github.com/mkn8rn/SharpClaw/security/advisories/new

All reports submitted through GitHub’s private reporting feature will be handled confidentially.

Vulnerability reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis. There are no guaranteed response or remediation timelines. Public disclosure should not occur until the issue has been reviewed and coordinated through the private reporting process.
